# Rolling-Cube-Maze-Simulator
**Problem:** Simplified Rolling Cube (SRC).

**Instance:** board height m, board width n,
 initial space (xi, yi), final space (xf , yf ), and
 desired final label ℓ, with an assumed orientation.

**Solution:** A string description of moves that
 takes the cube from initial space (xi, yi) to final
 space (xf , yf ) with desired label ℓ on top in the
 fewest moves without crossing over (xf , yf ), or
 False if there is no solution.

This project is a visualizer to aid in continued research of mazes with blocked spaces. An in-depth explanation of the algorithm implemented in this project for SRC can be found in *A Constant Time Algorithm for Solving Simple Rolling Cube Mazes* from the 2022 CCCG Proceedings. To launch this application, clone the repository to your device and run *Rolling Cube Mazes.exe*
